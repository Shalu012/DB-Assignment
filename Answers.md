1.Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans: The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is established through a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table.
In the "Product" table, there is a column named "category_id" which serves as a foreign key. This column references the "id" column in the "Product_category" table. This means that each entry in the "Product" table must have a corresponding entry in the "Product_category" table.
Practically, this relationship implies that each product belongs to a specific category. For example, if we have a product called "Laptop", it might belong to the "Electronics" category. The "category_id" column in the "Product" table would contain the ID of the "Electronics" category from the "Product_category" table, indicating the relationship between the two entities.


2.How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans: To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can use foreign key constraints in our database schema.
Here's how we can ensure this:

i.When creating the "Product" table, define the "category_id" column as a foreign key that references the "id" column in the "Product_category" table.

ii.This foreign key constraint will automatically enforce that any value inserted into the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must already exist in the "id" column of the "Product_category" table. If you try to insert a product with a category that doesn't exist in the "Product_category" table, the database will raise an error, preventing the insertion of invalid data.
